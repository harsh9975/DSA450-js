## Introduction

Understanding data structures and algorithms is crucial for writing efficient and optimized code. This repository aims to provide clear explanations and JavaScript implementations for a variety of data structures and algorithms commonly used in computer science.

## Data Structures

### Arrays

Arrays are one of the simplest and most widely used data structures. They store elements in contiguous memory locations, allowing for easy access and manipulation.

### Linked Lists

Linked lists consist of nodes connected by pointers. They provide dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations.

### Stacks

A stack is a Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are added and removed from the same end, typically the top.

### Queues

Queues are a First In, First Out (FIFO) data structure where elements are added at the rear and removed from the front.

### Trees

Trees are hierarchical data structures with a root element and branches. They are widely used in various applications, such as binary trees and AVL trees.

### Graphs

Graphs consist of nodes and edges, representing connections between nodes. They are essential for modeling relationships and dependencies.

### Hash Tables

Hash tables use a hash function to map keys to indices, providing efficient data retrieval and storage.

### Heaps

Heaps are specialized trees used to implement priority queues. They ensure that the highest (or lowest) priority element is always at the root.

## Algorithms

### Searching

Searching algorithms are used to find a specific element or location within a data structure. Common search algorithms include linear search, binary search, and depth-first search.

### Sorting

Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a specific order. Common sorting algorithms include bubble sort, quicksort, and mergesort.

### Recursion

Recursion involves solving a problem by breaking it down into smaller subproblems of the same type. Recursive algorithms often have a base case and a recursive case.

### Dynamic Programming

Dynamic programming is an optimization technique for solving problems by breaking them down into overlapping subproblems and solving each subproblem only once.

### Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each stage to achieve a globally optimal solution. They are often used in optimization problems.

### Backtracking

Backtracking is a technique for solving problems by trying out different possibilities and undoing choices that do not lead to a solution.

### Divide and Conquer

Divide and conquer involves breaking a problem into smaller subproblems, solving them independently, and combining their solutions to solve the original problem.
